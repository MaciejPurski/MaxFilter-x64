A simple project done using x86-64 assembler and C++/Qt for academic purpose.

Maximum filter is implemented in x64 assembler. It allows to filter bmp images with various filter frame size <0,10>. It was my first contact w x86 assembly for Warsaw University of Technology.

GUI is very basic. It was made in Qt/C++.
